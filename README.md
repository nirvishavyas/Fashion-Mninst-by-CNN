"project involving the Fashion MNIST dataset, which is essentially a collection of grayscale images of fashion items, 
each labeled into one of ten categories. The goal was to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify these 
images into their respective categories, essentially creating a model for fashion item recognition."
